# AI-Backend
A modular Streamlit application that demonstrates an end-to-end workflow of an AI-powered support automation system. The project simulates how user messages are collected, classified by an AI bot, transformed into structured tickets, assigned to consultants based on business rules, and managed through a simplified Teamwork-style portal.
